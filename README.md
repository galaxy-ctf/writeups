# Galaxy CTF writeups

We (@erasche and @shiltemann) will post our writeup and intended solutions here after the GCC CTF event ends.

And we encourage everybody to add their own writeups as well, we are curious to see what alternate solutions you came up with, what your thought process was, what you liked and what you did not.

If you would like to propose challenges for the next iteration, please contact one of us and your challenge may be part of next year's event!
