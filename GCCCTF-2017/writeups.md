## Challenge Writeups


### Warm-up 1: Start Here

**Challenge**  
Welcome Galactic Hackers! In this capture the flag competition you're hunting for these strings called "flags". These flags always begin with "gccctf{" followed by a message and ending with "}" This first challenge is super easy, simply copy this flag and claim your first point! `gccctf{th1s_i5_t0o_34sy!}`

**Solution (Galaxians)**  
This was just an introductory challenge to familiarize users with the flag submission
system. Only thing you had to do was copy and paste.

**Flag**  
```
gccctf{th1s_i5_t0o_34sy!}
```
